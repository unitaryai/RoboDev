#!/bin/sh
# setup-claude.sh — initialises Claude Code user config before running the agent.
#
# The home directory (/home/osmia) is an emptyDir volume that shadows any
# files baked into the image.  This script replicates the config files at
# container startup, matching the approach used in the PoC:
#   1. ~/.claude/settings.json  — grants permission for MCP tool use
#   2. /workspace/.mcp.json     — registers the osmia-slack MCP server
#      (project-scope file that Claude Code auto-loads from the cwd)
#   3. ~/.claude/skills/*.md    — custom skills injected via env vars (optional)
#
# The main claude invocation also passes --mcp-config /workspace/.mcp.json
# as an explicit belt-and-suspenders load path.
#
# Session persistence support:
#   CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR    — overrides ~/.claude; set by the session store to
#                          point at a PVC-backed directory so that session
#                          JSONL files survive pod restarts.
#   OSMIA_WORKSPACE_DIR  — when set and already populated (a .git directory
#                          is present), the git-clone step is skipped so the
#                          agent continues in the same workspace.
#
# Skill environment variables (set by the Osmia controller):
#   CLAUDE_SKILL_INLINE_<NAME>  — base64-encoded Markdown content for an inline skill
#   CLAUDE_SKILL_PATH_<NAME>    — path to a skill file on the container image
#
# NAME is the skill name with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by
# underscores and converted to uppercase (e.g. CREATE_CHANGELOG).
# The filename written is the lowercase, hyphenated form (e.g. create-changelog.md).

# the skill under it is listed; with it unset, only the one under ${HOME}.
